#RememberALL

This project is just for ~~fun~~ for learning a basic typescript fullstack developement.
It uses tRPC as a very useful instrument for fullstack developers, React on frontend, prisma (because i don't want to learn how to write CRUD operations on SQL lol) for manipulations with PostgreSQL on backend

##About project useless 
I know that this project is useless now, but i wanna do it a lot larger. If it won't be a startup, it will be a very nice project. Experience for me is the most needed. But if it will become a nice product (i think it not) I will continue my development. It's first, and i don't want to throw it away. I love it <3
